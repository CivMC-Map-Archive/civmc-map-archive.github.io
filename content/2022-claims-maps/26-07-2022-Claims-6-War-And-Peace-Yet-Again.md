TheJmqn: *Five maps today. The first two maps are normal claims maps, the third map is an alliance map, and the fourth map is a map of parties at war in "The Generic War" between Estalia and RI. The fifth map is a fun map of mentions per km^2.*

Note from maintainer: *Third, fourth, and fifth maps are not included in this page, but can be found on the source link above.*
