TheJmqn: *Not too many changes, server is pretty peaceful rn. here is the map anyways. the third image is a map of civmc geography from what i can tell, its pretty subjective tho. the fourth map is a test "federation" mapmode where federations are together.*

Note from maintainer: *Third and fourth maps are not included in this page, but can be found on the source link above.*
